# This readme is for TransGPSd version 0.1, released on April 3rd, 2003

# Notes:
#   To run TransGPSd you need a source of NMEA data.  It takes this source of
#   data over STDIN.  I did this so it'd be a little more flexible than GPSd.
#   If you don't have a GPS you can feed it raw NMEA by hand, cat it from a
#   text file, or have a friend SHELLcast their GPS to you.

# How to run TransGPSd (just one of the many ways):
#   cat NMEA_SOURCE | perl TransGPSd.pl

# How to get something useful out of it:
#   Well, for that you need a SOAP application that can understand TransGPSd
#   talk.  So far I have the following:
#     - A tracklogger (logs positions to a MySQL database)
#     - A GPS voice recorder (logs positions with a voice note and stores a
#                             reference to it in a MySQL database)
#
#   Applications on the horizon include:
#     - A satellite viewer (shows satellite status and position in real-time)
#     - A moving map (shows position at least relative to previous positions,
#                     it'll also be easy to superimpose it on a MapQuest map)
#
#   If none of these are on SourceForge when you read this, don't fret,
#   they'll be there soon.
