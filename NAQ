# This NAQ is for TransGPSd version 0.1, released on April 3rd, 2003

# What is TransGPSd?
#   This program is a GPS server (similar to gpsd) that connects to a GPS
#   via STDIN (serial support possibly in the future) and translates the
#   raw NMEA-0183 sentences to a usable format.
#
#   The external API is via SOAP.  It sends the client a structure containing
#   all the GPS data it has (and whether or not it believes this data is valid).
#   There are also SOAP based functions in the object to perform data conversion
#   (knots to MPH, DMS to decimal degress, etc).

# Why does everything have the pound/hash/splat/octothorpe/grid/square
# character in front of it in this file?!
#   This stuff used to be in the beginning of the source file until I realized
#   that that was really stupid.  All the stuff that wasn't is just that way
#   because it reminds me of Perl and Perl is good.

# Why are you releasing this?
#   Because GPS is cool and it ties in a lot of code and ideas I've had for
#   other projects.  Oh, and I thought other people could use/learn from it.

# This program sucks!
#   E-mail me at ntheory@cloud9.net.  Suggest something, submit something,
#   but please just don't let the hate fester in your head!  How else will
#   this program get better?  OK, OK, if you really, really don't like it/me
#   just write something better and e-mail it to me.  I love free GPS software.
